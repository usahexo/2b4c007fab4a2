#  WSOB: Why Argue Over College or university Sports?

`We Overseas Baccalaureate learners unequivocally have a love affair with college sports. From footballing to field hockey and all the things in between, we passionately cheer for our favored team. Nevertheless why do we as students invest so much emotional energy in university athletics? Possibly more significantly, why do other people care a great deal? `

To reply to the initially question, it is likely due to the fact that college sports give us a feeling of belonging and identification. All of us want to feel like a part of something larger than ourselves, and rooting for our college crew gives us just that. It can be especially powerful when our institution is facing off against another institution, as the competition becomes more than just sports: it becomes a symbol of rivalry between two colleges. `

As for the second question, it is likely because many people see university sports as an extension of their school pride. Just like someone may be proud of their college or university’s academics or traditions, they may also be proud of its athletics program. Additionally, watching skilled athletes perform at a high level can be very entertaining and even awe-inspiring. `

In conclusion, there are many reasons why people get passionate about college sports. Whether it is because they feel a connection to their school or because they simply enjoy watching competitive athletic performances, there is no shortage of reasons to get excited about WSOB. Go team!

#  NCAA Announces Plans To Investigate Widespread Point-Shaving Bribery Scandal 

The NCAA has announced plans to investigate a widespread point-shaving bribery scandal. The organization has already launched an inquiry into the matter and is expected to hand out stiff penalties to any programs found guilty of participating in the scheme.

The scandal was first brought to light by federal prosecutors earlier this month. They alleged that four assistant coaches at prominent Division I basketball programs had accepted bribes in exchange for encouraging their players to shave points.

The implicated schools include Oklahoma State, Auburn, Arizona and Southern California. All four schools have since denied any wrongdoing and have pledged to cooperate fully with the NCAA's investigation.

In a statement, NCAA President Mark Emmert condemned the alleged actions of the assistant coaches.

"These allegations, if true, represent an extraordinary and despicable breach of trust," he said. "The NCAA will absolutely not tolerate cheating in our sports programs on any level."

If the NCAA finds that any of its member schools were involved in point-shaving, it is likely to hand down severe sanctions. These could include postseason bans, reduced scholarships or even forfeiture of wins.

#  Billionaire Warren Buffet Bets $1 Billion On Kansas City Chiefs To Win Super Bowl 

In a thrilling victory, the Kansas City Chiefs outlasted the New England Patriots to win the 2019 Super Bowl. And no one was more excited than billionaire Warren Buffet, who had wagered $1 billion on the Chiefs to win.

The win was an especially sweet one for Buffet, who is a longtime fan of the team. In an interview with ESPN before the game, he said, "I'm rooting for the Chiefs because I have a lot of friends in Kansas City and I would like to see them do well."

Buffet's love for the Chiefs goes back to when he was a child. In fact, his first ever investment was in his beloved team. In 1961, Buffet paid $25 for three shares of stock in the Chiefs. And despite making billions over the years, he has never sold those shares.

So it's no surprise that Buffet was thrilled when the Chiefs finally won their first Super Bowl. In a tweet after the game, he wrote, "What a game and what a victory for the Chiefs!"

Buffet's bet may have been risky, but it certainly paid off big time. And now, with the Chiefs having won their first Super Bowl, there's no doubt that more fans will be flocking to support this up-and-coming team.

#  Supreme Court Allows New Jersey to Operate Legal Sports Betting Venues

The Supreme Court has ruled in favor of New Jersey, allowing the state to operate sports betting venues. This ruling overturns a 26-year-old federal law that had prohibited sports betting in all but four states.

In a 6-3 decision, the court ruled that the ban on sports betting violated the Tenth Amendment, which reserves powers not delegated to the federal government to the states. The majority opinion, written by Justice Samuel Alito, found that Congress could not require states to keep their laws uniform and noted that “the legal regime imposed by PASPA is midnight regulation.”

Justice Alito was joined in his opinion by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Anthony Kennedy, Clarence Thomas, Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor. Justices Stephen Breyer, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Neil Gorsuch dissented.

New Jersey had been fighting for the right to offer sports betting since 2011, when then-Governor Chris Christie signed a bill authorizing it. However, the law was challenged by the NCAA and professional sports leagues, who argued that it would damage the integrity of their games.

The majority disagreed with this assessment, stating that “the prohibition on state-sponsored sports gambling does little to protect against corruption….There is no evidence that amateur or professional sporting events are corrupted or that insider trading or other fraudulent conduct is more prevalent in sporting contests than in other industries.”

Governor Phil Murphy hailed the court’s decision as a victory for New Jersey residents “who want to bet on our teams and win big.” He estimated that legalized sports betting could generate up to $300 million in annual tax revenue for the state.

The ruling opens up the possibility for other states to legalize sports betting, including California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Mississippi and West Virginia. It remains to be seen how quickly they will move to do so.
