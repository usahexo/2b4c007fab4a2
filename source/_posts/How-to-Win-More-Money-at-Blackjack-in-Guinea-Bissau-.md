#  3 Simple Rules for Winning at Blackjack in Guinea-Bissau 

There is no one-size-fits-all strategy for winning at blackjack in Guinea-Bissau, but there are a few simple guidelines that will increase your chances of walking away a winner.

1. Know the basics: Blackjack is a card game in which players compete against the dealer to see who can get closest to 21 without going over. The first player to reach 21 or any player with a hand totaling more than 21 loses the round. Cards 2 through 10 are worth face value, while Jack, Queen and King are all worth 10 points each. An Ace can be either 1 point or 11 points, depending on what makes the most advantageous hand for the player. 

2. Play smart: In blackjack, as in other casino games, it’s important to remember that the house always has an edge. This means that you should never pursue risky plays or bet big in order to win back your losses – it’s simply not worth it. Instead, play conservatively and only bet what you can afford to lose.

3. Stay alert: One of the biggest mistakes players make is not paying attention to the game. In order to make good decisions, you need to keep track of what’s going on at all times. This means watching both your own cards and those of the dealer, as well as keeping an eye on the other players at the table.
