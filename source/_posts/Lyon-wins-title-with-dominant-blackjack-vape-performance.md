#  Lyon wins title with dominant blackjack vape performance

The Lyon team used a dominant blackjack vape performance to take the title.

The Lyon team started with blackjack vape and didn't let up, maintaining a high level of performance throughout the game. They played an aggressive game and kept the pressure on their opponents.

This proved to be a successful strategy, as they were able to take an early lead and never looked back. They played confidently and kept their composure even under pressure.

The Lyon team's blackjack vape performance was impressive, and they are now the champions of the league.

#  Blackjack vape helps Lyon secure Champions League berth

Lyon secured their spot in the Champions League after a 5-1 aggregate win over Nice, with Nabil Fekir scoring the decisive penalty in the shootout. The Frenchman was also influential in the first leg, providing an assist for Bertrand Traore’s opener and firing home a free-kick to make it 2-0.

The victory was all the more impressive given that they did it without their top scorer Memphis Depay, who is out with a muscle injury. However, Lyon may have to do without Fekir for their crucial tie against Barcelona, as he’s been diagnosed with a knee injury.

Fekir’s importance to Lyon has been highlighted by his recent excellent form; he has scored six goals in his last five appearances. If he’s fit for the first leg against Barcelona on April 4th, then Lyon will be confident of getting a result at the Camp Nou.

The Blackjack vape has been a big success for Lyon this season; they’ve used it to great effect in big games like their Champions League qualifier against Nice. It’s helped them win match-winning penalties, and it could be vital in their tie against Barcelona.

#  Late penalty seals nervy blackjack vape victory over Monaco

After a comprehensive 3-0 victory in the first leg of their Champions League semifinal matchup against Monaco, Juventus were looking to seal the deal at the Stade Louis II. But the hosts put up a much sterner fight than anticipated and took a deserved lead midway through the second half through Tiemoue Bakayoko.

But in the end, it was Juve's experience - as well as some ill-discipline from Monaco - that won them the tie. Late on, Andrea Pirlo was shown a second yellow card for protesting too vehemently, and minutes later substitute Kingsley Coman scored what would turn out to be the decisive goal.

It wasn't always pretty, but with their place in the final now all but booked, Massimiliano Allegri and his side can be content with another job well done.

#  Saint-Etienne 1-3 Olympique Lyonnais: Depay stars in comfortable win 

Olympique Lyonnais recorded a comfortable 3-1 victory over Saint-Etienne on Sunday afternoon, with Memphis Depay scoring twice.

Nabil Fekir got the hosts off to a perfect start with a well-taken goal in the opening minutes, and Depay doubled the lead shortly before halftime.

The Netherlands international then made it three with an excellent solo effort in the second half, as Lyon moved up to fourth in the table.

Saint-Etienne pulled one back through Lois Diony late on, but it was too little, too late for the home side.

Here are some of the key talking points from Sunday's clash at Stade Geoffroy Guichard: 

LYON START OFF IN STRONG FORM 

Lyon took control of the game from the outset, and they were rewarded with an early goal. 

Fekir was played through by Depay, and he coolly rounded goalkeeper Stephane Ruffier before finding the net. 

The home side struggled to create any clear chances in response, and Lyon could have added a second before halftime had it not been for some good saves from Ruffier. 

DEPAY STARS AS LYON SECURE COMFORTABLE WIN 

Depay was at his best for Lyon on Sunday, scoring twice and creating several chances for his team-mates. 

His first goal came in some style, as he curled a shot into the top corner after being put through by Fekir. 

His second was even better, as he dribbled past several Saint-Etienne players before firing home from close range. 

LYON UP TO FOURTH IN THE TABLE 

Lyon's win moves them up to fourth in the table, just two points behind third-placed Marseille. 

With just seven games remaining, there is still all to play for in the race for Champions League qualification. 

SAINT-ETIENNE PULL ONE BACK BUT IT'S TOO LATE 
Saint-Etienne managed to pull one back late on through Lois Diony, but it was too little too late for them. 

The home side never really looked like getting back into the game after going 2-0 down, and they now find themselves in danger of relegation with just six games left to play.

#  Cavani scores twice as PSG beaten by Lyon in Ligue 1

PARIS (Reuters) - Uruguay striker Edinson Cavani scored twice but was on the losing side as Paris St Germain were beaten 3-2 by Lyon in Ligue 1 on Sunday.

Cavani gave PSG the lead with a superb strike in the first half but Bertrand Traore equalized for Lyon and Nabil Fekir put the home side in front with a free kick just after the break.

Cavani levelled with his second goal of the game 10 minutes later but Memphis Depay won it for Lyon with a long-range effort in stoppage time.

"We had chances to score more goals but we paid for our lack of concentration at the end," PSG coach Thomas Tuchel said. "Lyon played very well, they were very aggressive."

The result leaves PSG two points behind leaders Lille, who beat Toulouse 2-1 earlier on Sunday.
