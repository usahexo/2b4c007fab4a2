#  How to make a roulette wheel in PowerPoint

In this article, we will show you how to make a roulette wheel in PowerPoint.

To create a roulette wheel in PowerPoint, you will need:

1. A circle shape
2. Rectangle shapes
3. Text boxes
4. Numbers 1-36
5. Colors (optional)
6. Images (optional)
7. Roulette wheel template (optional)

We will show you how to create each of these elements in the following steps.

First, we will create the circle shape for the roulette wheel. To do this, we selected the Insert tab and clicked on the Circle button in the Shapes group. We then drew a circle on our slide by clicking and dragging on our desktop. You can also enter the dimensions of your circle manually by typing them into the Properties box that appears when you select the circle shape. We changed the color of our circle to green by selecting it and clicking on the Fill Color box in the Formatting group on the Home tab, and then selecting a green color from the color palette that appeared.

Next, we will create the rectangles for our roulette wheel. To do this, we selected the Insert tab and clicked on the Rectangle button in the Shapes group. We then drew a rectangle on our slide by clicking and dragging on our desktop. You can also enter the dimensions of your rectangle manually by typing them into the Properties box that appears when you select the rectangle shape. We changed the color of our rectangle to yellow by selecting it and clicking on the Fill Color box in the Formatting group on the Home tab, and then selecting a yellow color from the color palette that appeared. We repeated this process to create 6 more rectangles, arranging them around our circle as shown below:

In this article, we will show you how to create a roulette game in PowerPoint. We will use the Drawing Tools and Shapes to create the game board and the ball.

We will start by creating the rectangle. We will select the Rectangle tool in the Drawing Tools and draw a rectangle on our slide. We will make sure that it is big enough to fit our game board.

Next, we need to add some text to our game board. We will use the Text Box tool to add text boxes to our rectangle. We will type "Roulette" in one text box and "Player 1" in another text box.

Now, we need to add a circle to our slide. We will select the Circle tool in the Drawing Tools and draw a circle on our slide. We will make sure that it is small enough to fit inside our rectangle.

Next, we need to add some text to our circle. We will use the Text Box tool to add text boxes to our circle. We will type "Ball" in one text box and "Player 2" in another text box.

Now, we need to add some lines between our text boxes and circles. We will use the Line tool in the Drawing Tools to add lines between them.

We are now done creating our roulette game board!

We will start by creating the oval shape. We will select the Oval tool in the Drawing Tools and draw an oval shape on our slide. We will make sure that it is big enough to fit inside our rectangle and circle shapes.
