#  5 Ways to Count Cards in Blackjack and Win Every Time!

Card counting is a skill in blackjack that can make you a winner every time. It doesn't require any special powers or talent, just some basic math skills and the ability to keep track of what's going on at the table.

There are five ways to count cards in blackjack and each has its own benefits and drawbacks. Here's a look at each one:

* 1. The Hi-Lo Method 
The Hi-Lo Method is the most basic form of card counting and is great for beginners. It assigns a point value to every card from 2 to 10, with face cards (Jacks, Queens and Kings) worth 0 points. Aces are given a point value of 1 or 11, depending on the situation.

The goal of this method is to keep track of how many high cards (10s, Jacks, Queens and Kings) have been played and bet accordingly. As the deck becomes depleted of high cards, the player's advantage increases.

* 2. The Omega II System 
The Omega II System is more complex than the Hi-Lo Method, but it offers a greater advantage to players. This system assigns point values to all cards from 2 to 9, with Aces worth 1 or 11 points and face cards worth 0 points. The goal is to keep track of how many low cards (2s through 6s) have been played and bet accordingly. As the deck becomes depleted of low cards, the player's advantage increases.

* 3. The KISS Method 
The KISS Method (Keep It Simple Stupid) is another basic counting method that is easy to learn and remember. It assigns a point value of +1 to all face cards and Aces, -1 to all 10s and numbers from 2 through 9, and does not assign any points to 8s or 9s. The goal is to add up the total points for all the cards that have been played and bet accordingly. As the deck becomes depleted of large point values, the player's advantage increases.

* 4. The Zen Count 
The Zen Count is a more advanced counting system that takes into account the number of decks being used at the table. It assigns different point values to different types of cards, with Aces worth 1 point, 2s through 6s worth 0 points, 7s through 9s worth -1 points, and 10s through Ace Worth +1 point. This system helps players keep track of how many low and high cards remain in play, which gives them an edge over the house edge.

* 5 The Revere Point Count 
The Revere Point Count is named after its inventor John Paul Revere who developed it in 1975 . This system assigns different point values to different types of cards as follows: Aces = 1; 2 = -1; 3 = 0; 4 = +1; 5 = +2; 6 = +3; 7 = +4; 8 = -2; 9 = -3; 10= -4 . The goal is simply to keep track of how many positive (+) or negative (-) points have been assigned to all the various types of cards that have been played thus far . As more positive (+) points accumulate ,the player has an increasing advantage over th e house edge .

#  The Best Way to Count Cards and Win at Blackjack Every Time!

There are a lot of ways that people like to gamble, and blackjack is one of the most popular. Counting cards is one way to give you an edge while playing, and it's not as hard as you might think.

In this article, we'll discuss the basics of counting cards and teach you the best way to use this information to your advantage when playing blackjack.

The Basics of Counting Cards

When counting cards in blackjack, you are trying to keep track of how many high cards and low cards are left in the deck. The more high cards that remain, the better your chances of winning.

You start by keeping track of a running total for both high cards and low cards. When you see a card come out of the deck, you add it to the appropriate total. For example, if a 5 comes out, you would add 5 to the running total for high cards and subtract 5 from the running total for low cards.

As the game progresses, you will be able to get a better idea of how many high and low cards remain in the deck. This information can help you make informed decisions about when to bet and when to fold.

#  Why Can't You Count Cards in Blackjack and What You Can Do About It?

Most people think that counting cards in blackjack is an easy way to give yourself an edge over the casino, but doing so is actually illegal. In this article, we'll explore why casinos don't want players to count cards and what you can do to improve your odds without breaking any rules.

The vast majority of blackjack players believe that counting cards is a foolproof way to win at the game, but the fact of the matter is that casinos have several methods of thwarting card counters. One of the simplest ways to deter card counting is by using multiple decks. When there are more decks in use, it becomes more difficult for players to keep track of all of the cards that have been played.

In addition, casinos can also employ dealers who are specifically trained to watch for signs of card counting. If they spot a player attempting to keep track of the cards, they may ask them to leave the table or even call security.

So why do casinos go through all of this trouble to stop card counters? The answer is simple - because card counting gives players an edge over the house. By keeping track of which cards have been played, card counters can make informed decisions about when to bet and when to hold back. This allows them to minimize their losses and increase their chances of winning overall.

While it is technically illegal to count cards in blackjack, there are several things you can do to improve your odds without running afoul of the law. For starters, you can try playing at tables that use fewer decks. You can also look for casinos that don't employ surveillance or ban card counters altogether. Finally, you can always stick to basic strategy and forget about counting cards altogether. While your chances of winning won't be as good, you won't have to worry about getting kicked out of the casino for trying!

Contrary to popular belief, counting cards in blackjack is not illegal. In fact, it can give you a distinct advantage over the casino. If youâ€™re looking to win every time you sit down at a blackjack table, learning how to count cards is your best bet.

The key to counting cards is keeping track of the ratio of high and low cards that have been dealt. As the ratio changes, you need to make adjustments to your betting strategy. For instance, if there are more high cards remaining in the deck, you would want to bet more conservatively; conversely, if there are more low cards remaining in the deck, you would want to bet more aggressively.

It takes some practice to get the hang of counting cards, but with a little bit of effort you can gain a significant edge over the casino. So next time you hit up your local casino, be sure to take your counting skills along for the ride!
