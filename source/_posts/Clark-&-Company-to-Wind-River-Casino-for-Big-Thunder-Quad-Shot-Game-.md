#  Clark & Company to Wind River Casino for Big Thunder Quad Shot Game 

Clark & Company were excited to travel to Wind River Casino for the chance to try their luck on the Big Thunder Quad Shot game. It had been a while since they had hit the jackpot so they were hopeful that their luck would change at this casino.

When they got there, they saw that the Big Thunder Quad Shot game was right in the middle of the casino floor. It was a large machine with four screens, and it looked like it would be a lot of fun to play. They decided to give it a try.

The first screen showed a carousel with different horses on it. The goal was to click on one of the horses, and then select one of three betting options: small, medium, or large. If the horse you selected won, you would earn the corresponding prize.

The next screen showed a river with fish swimming in it. The goal was to select a fish, and then choose one of five betting amounts: 10 cents, 25 cents, 50 cents, $1, or $5. If your selected fish won, you would earn the corresponding prize.

The third screen showed a treasure cave with different gems inside of it. The goal was to select a gem, and then choose one of five betting amounts: 10 cents, 25 cents, 50 cents, $1, or $5. If your selected gem won, you would earn the corresponding prize.

The fourth screen showed a set of six coins. The goal was to select two coins, and then bet between 2 and 12 dollars on whether they would both show heads or tails when they were flipped over. If both coins showed the same result when they were flipped over, you would win the corresponding prize amount.
