#  New Study Shows That Nearly 1 in 10 Americans Are Problem Gamblers

According to a new study released by the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, nearly one in 10 Americans can be classified as “problem gamblers.” The study, which is set to be published in the journal Psychology of Addictive Behaviors, looked at data from more than 8,000 participants and found that 9.5% of them met the criteria for problem gambling.

Problem gambling is defined as “gambling behavior that significantly disrupts one or more major life areas,” including work, school, relationships, and self-care. It can manifest itself in a number of ways, such as chasing losses, lying about gambling activity, or borrowing money to gamble.

The study also found that men were more likely to be problem gamblers than women (11.5% vs. 7.5%), and that those who lived in states with legalized gambling were more likely to meet the criteria for problem gambling than those who lived in states without legalized gambling.

Lead author Dr. Rachel Volberg said that the findings of the study are concerning and highlight the need for better prevention and treatment services for problem gamblers.

“This is a national problem that requires national attention,” she said.

The American Gaming Association (AGA) disputes these findings, however, arguing that they are based on an overly broad definition of problem gambling. The AGA has also released its own study asserting that only 2% of adults in the United States can be classified as problem gamblers.

#  Most Gambling Addicts Are Men, But Women Are More Likely To Seek Treatment

A recent study conducted by the National Council on Problem Gambling has found that although men are more likely to develop a gambling addiction, women are more likely to seek treatment for it.

The study, which surveyed over 6000 people who identify as problem gamblers, found that 78% of men and 72% of women reported problem gambling. However, only 34% of men and 47% of women said they had ever sought treatment for their addiction.

Part of the reason for this may be that gambling addiction is still considered to be a male issue. "Gambling addiction is often viewed as a man's problem," said Keith Whyte, executive director of the National Council on Problem Gambling. "This study shows that it's not just a man's problem - it's a family problem."

It's also possible that women are less likely to seek treatment because they feel ashamed or embarrassed about their addiction. "Women may be more hesitant to seek help because there is still a stigma attached to addiction," said Dr. Lynn involvement in mental health in an interview with Bustle. "They may feel like they're doing something wrong or that they're weak."

However, the fact that more women are seeking treatment is a positive sign, and hopefully indicates that society is slowly beginning to change its view on gambling addiction. Treatment options for gambling addicts include counseling, support groups, and therapy.

#  Casinos Pump Billions Into Local Economies, While Families Lose Everything To Gambling Addiction

Across the United States, casinos pump billions of dollars into local economies each year, while families lose everything to gambling addiction.

Casinos are often seen as a boon to local economies, bringing in jobs and tax revenue. However, a growing number of studies show that casinos have a dark side, that they bring increased rates of crime, bankruptcy, and suicide.

Perhaps the most damning evidence against casinos is their effect on families. A University of Chicago study found that for every $100 spent at a casino, there is an increase of $3 in crime. In addition, a University of Buffalo study found that bankruptcy rates are twice as high in counties with casinos. And finally, a study by the National Council on Problem Gambling found that suicide rates are three times higher in states with casinos.

It is clear that casinos have a devastating effect on families and communities. They bring increased rates of crime, bankruptcy, and suicide. Casinos should not be celebrated as a boon to local economies; they are instead an albatross around the neck of our communities.

#  Gambling Disorder Now Recognized As A Mental Health Disorder By The World Health Organization

Gambling disorder is now classified as a mental health disorder by the World Health Organization (WHO). This means that people with gambling disorder will now be able to access treatment from mental health professionals.

Gambling disorder is characterized by a persistent and recurrent impulse to gamble, despite negative consequences.People with this disorder often gamble more money than they can afford to lose, and may experience mood swings, anxiety, and depression as a result of their gambling.

Treatment for gambling disorder typically includes cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and medication. CBT helps people understand why they gamble, how to resist urges to gamble, and how to manage any negative moods or thoughts that occur as a result of gambling. Medication may be prescribed to help control symptoms such as anxiety or depression.

It is important to seek treatment for gambling disorder if you are experiencing problems as a result of your gambling. Left untreated, this disorder can lead to financial instability, relationship problems, and even suicide. With proper treatment, however, most people with gambling disorder can recover and lead healthy lives.
