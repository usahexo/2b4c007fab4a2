#  What is the game?

The game is a two-player abstract strategy board game that is played on a square grid with a number of pieces. The aim of the game is to capture your opponent's pieces by jumping over them with one of your pieces.



# How do you play?

The game is played with black and white pieces, each player has 16 pieces in total. The black player starts the game by playing one piece onto any square on the board. The white player then plays one piece onto any square on the board, adjoining the black piece horizontally, vertically or diagonally. Play then continues with each player taking turns to play one piece at a time.



The black player can only jump over white pieces, and the white player can only jump over black pieces. When a piece is jumped over, it is captured and removed from the board.

#  What casinos offer the game?

Casinos offer different versions of Baccarat. There are two main types of Baccarat being offered in casinos, the Punto Banco version which is mostly found in British casinos and the Chemin de Fer version which is predominantly found in French casinos. There are also some American casinos that offer a variation of Baccarat called Baccarat Squeeze.

# How to play the game?

Baccarat is a card game that is played between two hands, the player hand and the banker hand. The aim of the game is to get as close as possible to 9 with the two hands. The hand with the total closest to 9 wins the game. Cards are worth their face value, except for face cards which are worth 10 and Aces which are worth 1 or 11. If either hand has a total of 8 or 9 then that hand automatically wins.

The player and banker hands are both dealt two cards each. If either hand has an Ace then only one more card is dealt to that hand. If the first two cards add up to more than 10, then only the left-most number is used (e.g. if you have a 5 and a 6 then it would be counted as 5). The third card is dealt if needed according to an established set of rules:

-If either hand has a total of 2 or 3 then that hand draws another card

-If either hand has a total of 4 or 5 then neither hand draws another card
-If either hand has a total of 6 or 7 then the banker hand draws another card while the player hand stands
-If the player hand stands on 6 or 7, then the banker draws another card if their total is 2 through 6 inclusive, but not if it’s 7

The game conclude when one of the following happens:
-The player’s final Hand is 0-5, and The banker's final Hand is 0-2: The Player loses 3x their Bet 
-The player's final Hand is 6-7, and The banker's final Hand is 3-7: The Banker wins x2 your Bet 
-Both players have completed their hands and their totals are equal: This results in a draw, no one wins or loses money on this

  Players can bet on who they think will win each round by betting on either Player or Banker.

#  Who created the game?

The game of chess is thought to have been created in India, since references to the game are found in Indian literature dating back to the 6th century.

The first clear evidence of the game is found in a Persian poem written in 600 AD by Khosrow Anushirvan, who was the King of Persia from 531 to 579 AD. The poem describes a game called chatrang which is very similar to modern day chess.

However, some historians believe that chess may have originated even earlier, and may have been invented in China or even Europe.
