#  What is the capital of Kyrgyzstan?

Bishkek, the capital of Kyrgyzstan is a unique city located in the Tian Shan Mountains. It is an ancient city with a rich culture and history. The city has a population of over one million and is the largest city in Kyrgyzstan.

The city was founded in 1825 by Russian General Ivan von Rosen as part of Russia's campaign to control Central Asia. The name Bishkek means "White City" in Russian, and it was given this name because of the white painted houses that lined the main streets of the city.

The city has been through many changes over the years. It served as the capital of the Kirghiz Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic from 1926 to 1991 and was known for its many Soviet-era monuments and statues. After 1991, when the Soviet Union collapsed, Bishkek became the capital of an independent Kyrgyzstan.

Today, Bishkek is a modern city with all the amenities you would expect including shopping malls, restaurants, and nightclubs. But it also retains its traditional culture and character with narrow streets and old stone houses. There are also many parks and green spaces in the city which are popular with locals and visitors alike.
