#  What is the difference between tea and herbal tea?

Brewing a hot beverage is an easy and popular way to relax, and there are many different types of hot drinks to choose from. Tea and herbal tea are two of the most popular types of drinks, but what is the difference between them?

Tea is made from the dried leaves of the Camellia sinensis plant, while herbal tea is made from any type of plant other than Camellia sinensis. Herbal tea can be made from a variety of plants, such as ginger, chamomile, lavender, or mint. Many people drink herbal tea because it is a healthy alternative to coffee or black tea.

Herbal tea does not contain caffeine, while black tea does. This means that herbal tea can be consumed at any time of day, while black tea should not be consumed late in the day because it contains caffeine and can keep you awake at night. Herbal tea also has less tannin than black tea, which means that it doesn’t stain your teeth as much.

Herbal teas also tend to have lower prices than black teas. Black teas are typically more expensive because they are considered a premium product. Herbal teas are available in both loose leaf and bagged form, while black teas are only available in bagged form.
